        6. Concluding remarks and future directions in the field

        This review paper discussed and presented latest research
        findings that were included within

        the JCELPRO VSI SpliTech2019 and dedicated to the 4th
        International Conference on Smart

        and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech2019). The contributions
        as well as herein presented

        knowledge is summarized and discussed in upcoming sections.

        The Intense digitalization in recent years has allowed for
        different technological possibilities

        that have already gradually been changing the main economic
        sectors and societies in general.

        Digitalization in different economic sectors enabled various
        possibilities for advancements

        and for a more efficient utilization of limited resources,
        systems or processes. The main driver

        for an efficient digitalization in various sectors is
        information technology, i.e., IoT supported

        smart technologies. In the previous sense, the energy sector is
        one of the key sectors where

        ‘’energy digitalization’’ has already been rapidly developing in
        various energy related fields.

        Currently, one of the most progressing implementation areas of
        IoT technologies is related to

        the energy sector. The developing solutions are focused on smart
        homes, i.e. advanced

        automatization of home energy systems, development of smart and
        adaptive micro-grids, or

        advancements in efficient demand-side management of power
        systems. A circular economy

        concept has also been intensively worked on where various
        concepts have been investigated,

        which can support smart waste management and help bridge one of
        the main challenges in

        society. Recently, different concepts have been tested where IoT
        technologies could be used

        for environmental protection, primarily for the monitoring of
        air quality, which is a big

        potential in that sense.       Healthcare systems can also be
        significantly improved with the application of IoT

        devices, i.e. via the E-health concept. An improved quality of
        services and patient safety

        could be enabled with an advanced IoT supported monitoring
        system. The prediction of life

        threatening states could be efficiently detected with a better
        treatment of patients, such as

        timely therapy decisions and qualitative rehabilitation. In
        general, large healthcare systems

        could also benefit from IoT, both in efficiency and from a cost
        aspect, which is important for

        hospitals. The current pandemic state with COVID-19 allowed for
        the consideration of

        different IoT applications or devices that could help in
        efficiently monitoring and controlling

        the pandemic, which proves the added value of IoT products.

        The transportation sector is currently in gradual transition
        where a mix of transportation

        vehicle technologies is expected in upcoming decades with the
        involvement of electric

        vehicles primarily along with hybrid or hydrogen based vehicles.
        The main advancements of

        IoT in transportation are the support of the smart car concept
        where different vehicle

        operating parameters can be monitored in an efficient manner.
        The main advantage is early

        detection of severe failures, then regular maintenance, improved
        fuelling and finally

        improvement of safety and driving experience in general. The
        most challenging IoT

        application area is in the case of autonomous vehicles, where
        safety is the main goal and in

        that sense, significant research advancements are expected to
        occur in the near future.

        The smart city concept is the most progressing IoT application
        area since cities have

        been vastly populated, which causes severe infrastructural
        issues. The main benefit of IoT

        technologies in the smart city concept is to bridge severe
        infrastructural challenges in highly

        populated cities. The improvement of life quality in cities is
        also expected thanks to the

        efficiency improvement of various convectional services in
        cities. The early detection of

        various and common daily problems in cities could be efficiently
        solved with IoT as with

        transportation issues, energy and water shortage supplies,
        security issues, etc. The biggest

        challenge in the smart city concept is directed to the efficient
        networking and operation of

        different sensing technologies, which must be followed with the
        proper education of the

        population.

        Each technology that is rapidly progressing has got specific
        potential drawbacks that need

        to be carefully analysed and addressed. Since IoT devices are
        measured in billions, and with

        large potential impacts on the population, specific challenges
        need to be addressed, which

        were detected based on the herein conducted review. The main
        goal is to secure a sustainable

        and balanced development of IoT technologies. Therefore, further
        issues are briefly discussed

        below and should be carefully considered during the further
        development of IoT technologies:  - the rapid development of IoT
        technologies causes fast consumption of raw materials to

        produce different electronic devices where unfortunately some of
        raw materials are

        already rare or becoming,

        - electronic devices are becoming more economically acceptable
        where a potentially

        large population would be affected. High production volumes are
        expected which can

        finally cause a rebound effect and a more rapid unwanted
        utilization of already limited

        resources,

        - the sustainability aspect and long-term effects of IoT
        technologies are not clear and

        insufficiently investigated. A noticeable amount of energy would
        be needed to operate

        IoT devices and the electronic industry is leaving different
        unfavourable

        environmental footprints that also need to be carefully
        investigated,

        - electronic waste will become one of the major issues caused
        with the planned rise of

        IoT products. Recycling rates must be improved and better
        e-waste management

        should be secured,

        - IoT technologies can cause social impacts in specific
        industrial branches or businesses

        since working labour could be reduced and direct social contacts
        have also been

        reduced. In that sense, the application of IoT technologies
        should be carefully

        considered taking the raised issues into account,

        - significant advancements in both specific electronic
        components as well as userfriendly

        software solutions are required,

        - further development in sensing technologies and advanced data
        acquisition systems is

        also required,

        - the minimization of energy consumption in IoT devices is a
        crucial target, i.e.

        reduction of energy supply.

        From the herein addressed recent research findings within the
        VSI SpliTech2019, it is obvious

        that developments in various IoT application sectors are
        promising but further advancements

        are expected and that are mainly focused on maximizing the
        efficiency of specific IoT

        supported processes or technologies, minimizing resource
        utilization (raw materials and

        energy) and environmental footprints. IoT technologies are an
        opportunity for humanity and

        can bring important as well as useful benefits to the
        population. The authors contributions

        within the JCLEPRO VSI SpliTech2019 provided quality discussion
        and presentation of the

        latest advancements in the field, and most important, they
        contributed to the better understanding of IoT application
        areas, technological possibilities, but also potential

        drawbacks and issues that should be carefully monitored in
        future terms. The crucial and

        important aspects are linked with sustainability where the rapid
        developments in IoT

        technologies must be carefully monitored from a resource and
        environmental point of view to

        ensure balanced and sustainable development of IoT products.
        Herein presented knowledge

        and published works in the Journal of Cleaner Production are
        serving as important

        foundations for researchers dealing with this challenging and
        dynamic research field.

        “II. EVOLUTION OF INTERNET In the good old days where we were
        denied of web, the human correspondence was uniquely through
        phones or mobiles. Sometimes communicating through landline
        became a problem for us because in the early days first we were
        to reserve a call with the operator. Then after hours or so, the
        operator would fix whenever your call is possible to join with
        the connector. Then comes the beginning of interne era, that
        changed everything around us. With the help frequent involvement
        of internet, sharing of information became quite easy as
        compared to before. Regardless of any geographical locations,
        information could be shared with anyone who is poles apart. Now
        comes the life that carries both boon and bane of internet that
        we are using today and that has made its space so much into our
        life by just existing. Development of various website that
        contains millions of texts to describe something. Myspace and
        LinkedIn ended up conspicuous in the mid 2000s; YouTube won in
        2005 making business open entryways for such countless people
        out there. By 2006 come the two social networking sites that
        changed the life of many people, Facebook and Twitter, these
        systems administration locales helped individuals to think of
        their feelings and thoughts of what they are managing in their
        consistently to day life. It creates a platform where users
        share their side of story and let whole world be aware and make
        it more substantial by attaching pictures.” (Upmanyu, 2022, p. 615)

      o

        “X. CONCLUSION The study of Internet of Things clearly depicts
        that “change is inevitable”, according to a survey, it shows
        that there are 500 billion devices that are connected to 7.6
        billion population till we reach 2020. As the population become
        more and more used to IoT, there are 6.58 devices connected per
        person. With any increase in advancement of technology, it comes
        with various criticisms and controversy. But still with all its
        applications that comes in handy, its trend will increase and so
        will the application of IoT. Even when the masses do not know
        about much about the working of IoT, IoT still will make its
        place among the trending. In no time or soon enough we might
        witness the application of IoT in every home like smart home. If
        we see through a haste glance, there are many challenges
        awaiting for IoT but it’s huge. There are so many branches that
        are linked to IoT that it’s merely countless .IoT is applicable
        in almost everything” (Upmanyu, 2022, p. 622)

        Internet of Things: Energy boon or bane?

    Item Type 	Journal Article
    Author 	Eric Hittinger
    Author 	Paulina Jaramillo
    Abstract 	Networked digital devices may cause rising energy use,
    although devices save energy locally , Since the dawn of the
    internet, a digital revolution has transformed life for millions of
    people. Digital files have replaced paper, email has replaced
    letters, and cell phones provide access to many services that
    facilitate daily life. This digital revolution is not over, and
    there is now a growing deployment of technologies grouped under the
    term “Internet of Things” (IoT)—a worldwide network of
    interconnected objects that are uniquely addressable via standard
    communication protocols ( 1 ). By 2020, there may be as many as 30
    billion objects connected to the internet ( 2 ), all of which
    require energy. These devices may yield direct energy savings ( 3 ,
    4 ), but it is much less clear what their net effect on the broader
    energy system will be. Scientists and regulators will need to work
    together to ensure that the IoT's benefits do not come at the
    expense of rising energy use.

        IoT-based Enterprise Resource Planning: Challenges, Open Issues,
        Applications, Architecture, and Future Research Directions

        Abstract

        In today’s highly competitive markets, organizations can create
        a competitive advantage through the successful implementation of
        Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. ERP works with
        different technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT).
        IoT uses a unique Internet protocol to identify, control, and
        transfer data to individuals as well as databases. The data is
        collected through IoT, stored on the cloud, and extracted and
        managed in through ERP. In this study, we review the challenges,
        open issues, applications, and architecture of the IoT-based
        ERP. For this purpose, we review and analyze the latest
        IoT-related articles to present the unique features of the IoT
        and discuss its impact on ERP. The results show sensors and
        devices connected to the Internet can manage the stored data
        processed in the cloud through ERP without human intervention.
        We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in the
        relationship between ERP and the IoT risen by the introduction
        of the cloud.

        Keywords: Internet of things; enterprise resource planning;
        cloud computing.

        1. Introduction

        Companies in various industries collect different types of data,
        including invoices, customer information, project schedules,
        shipping, and payment information, among others (Rashid, 2002).
        Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) plays a critical role in
        streamlining processes and improving business operations across
        industries (Mahmud, 2017). Today, the Internet of Things (IoT)
        and massive data influxes are stirring up the ERP landscape,
        introducing new possibilities for operational excellence and
        workflow automation (Snellman, 2017; Bahssas et al., 2015). IoT
        is evolving rapidly, and according to McKinsey’s report on the
        global economic effect of IoT, the annual economic impact of IoT
        in 2025 will range from 2.7 to 6.2 trillion dollars (Andročec et
        al., 2018; Sha et al., 2019). However, in the midst of the
        excitement for increasing connectivity in manufacturing, the
        impact of IoT has on ERP systems, and business processes should
        not be overlooked (Balampanis et al., 2016).

        Every system component in the IoT has an IP address, which
        enables the computers to identify, control, transfer data to
        other individuals, and related databases (Siddiqui et al., 2019;
        Siegemund and Turau, 2018). The collected data, stored in the
        cloud, enables ERP to manage, control, and process the data.
        Overall, the integration of ERP into IoT provides a great number
        of opportunities, the most important of which includes better
        management, automation, product traceability, and reduce ERP
        implementation costs (Zadeh et al., 2018). IoT creates a
        connection between the product and the customer by reducing
        human intervention and promoting automation using sensors.
        However, the integration of IoT into ERP faces a lot of
        challenges, and the biggest challenge is the lack of trust in
        IoT as a relatively new technology trend. Data security is a top
        concern, and companies heavily investing in ERP are very wary of
        the accuracy and reliability of the data coming from an IoT
        system (Sha et al., 2019; Stergiou et al., 2018). After almost
        three decades since their introduction, ERP systems are so
        well-oiled that a single record could represent a few million
        dollars. It is simply risky to trust new technology, and in a
        large-scale ERP implementation, nobody wants to save money
        unless it is millions of dollars (Snellman, 2017; Elmonem, 2016;
        Lenart, 2011).

        In this study, we review the challenges, open issues,
        applications, and ERP-based IoT architectures. The latest
        journal papers at the intersection of ERP and IoT are reviewed
        and analyzed. We further demonstrate the relationship between
        ERP with cloud-based services. In Section 2, we present a brief
        history of ERP and IoT. In Section 3, we present the technologies

        3

        and platforms in cloud ERP. In Section 4, we present the IoT,
        and in Section 5, we present our conclusions and future research
        directions:

        2. History of ERP and IoT

        Demonstrating a history of ERP systems, Table 1 shows that IoT
        was introduced in 1999 by Kevin Ashton (Alam et al., 2017). The
        growth of technology in ERP is also shown in Figure 1. As can be
        seen in Figure 1, the use of Internet technology in ERP has
        increased from 2000 with the use of the Internet and extranet
        technology (Sumner, 2014). Insert Figure 1 and Table 1 Here

        The evolution of ERP systems came just after the development of
        hardware and software systems. During the 1960s, most
        organizations designed, developed, and implemented centralized
        computing systems, most of which automated warehouse inventory
        control systems using inventory control (IC) packages. Essential
        Requirements Planning (ERP) systems were developed in the 1970s.
        In these systems, sectoral or product requirements planning is
        based on a comprehensive production plan. New software programs,
        such as product resource planning (MRP II), were introduced,
        focusing on the synchronization of the production process with
        the production requirements to optimize the production
        processes. Systems with ERP systems technologies first appeared
        in the late 1980s and early 1990s and had the power to
        coordinate and integrate operations throughout the company.
        Using MRP technology, ERP systems achieve the integration
        between business processes such as manufacturing, distribution,
        accounting, finance, human resources, project management,
        Inventory management, maintenance, and Logistics. This
        integration also creates accessibility and visibility, as well
        as unity throughout the company.

        Developments in ERP include planning and scheduling (APS),
        Internet business solutions, including customer relationship
        management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM). Figure 2
        shows the major historical events related to ERP. During this
        decade, ERP has been associated with mainframe and mini and
        macro computer technologies, as well as data warehousing, data
        mining, knowledge management, and client-server networks with a
        distributed database and knowledge management. The first decade
        of the 20th century also saw ERP working with low-end IoT
        technologies, mainframes, client-server systems, distributed
        computing, Internet technology, and knowledge management. Today,
        there are many different systems on the market, most of which
        are migrating outside the cloud. Insert Figure 2 Here

        4

        The company’s hardware provides the bases for the local
        installation of the conventional on-site ERP systems, while
        cloud ERP does not require such hardware. In other words, it is
        considered to be a service that works through providers and
        programs and is accessible through web applications. Each
        company can choose from a range of various ERP systems to
        deploy, and of course, the choice depends on a number of factors
        such as the data storage location as well as software hosting.
        The changes made to ERP implementation over time led to changes
        in the way the companies use ERP. Initially, the systems were
        small and not very functional, and they were developed to
        perform a specific task. So companies have no choice but to
        install and use various systems to perform all the tasks and
        provide management that a company needs. In many cases, the
        existence of small systems is indicative of the fact that there
        will be a lot of integration and communication among these
        systems. It also means that there is a lot of traffic coming
        through the network, and there are more risks involved, that is
        caused, ERP works with Internet technologies, mobile wireless,
        artificial intelligence, grid computing, knowledge management,
        web service architecture over the years and decades.As can be
        seen in Figure 1, the use of Internet technology in ERP has
        increased from 2000 with the use of the Internet and Extranet
        technology, which will reach its peak in 2020.

        3. Cloud ERP: Technologies and platforms

        This section will discuss cloud ERP technologies and platforms.
        First, the advantages and disadvantages of cloud ERP versus
        on-premise ERP are discussed in Table 2; then, different cloud
        ERP vendors are introduced, and ERP technology explored(Monk and
        Wagner, 2012; Rashid et al., 2002). Insert Table 2 Here

        As can be seen in Figure 1, distributed, web-based, artificial
        intelligence and other technologies have been more frequently
        used in recent years. Therefore, this report highlights five IoT
        technologies, namely blockchain, artificial intelligence,
        machine learning, and big data. The following will explore what
        platforms can work with these technologies. As shown in Figure
        2, the platforms that can work with IoT include SAP, Oracle,
        Microsoft, Epicor, Sage, Netsuite, and People Soft.

        The platforms that can work with blockchain technology include
        SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Azure, and IBM. SAP, Oracle, Microsoft
        Azure, and IBM are the technologies that can work with machine
        learning technology and artificial intelligence. Finally, the
        platforms capable of working

        5

        with big data technology are SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Azure
        (Snellman, 2017).

        4. Internet of things (IoT)

        The term Internet of Things (IoT) was coined by Kevin Ashton in
        1999. He described a world where everything had a digital
        identity for itself and enabled computers to organize and manage
        things. For Kevin Ashton, “IoT” is a tool to overcome the
        domination of time and place. This view was first popularized by
        the Center for Automatic Identification and relevant market
        analysis publications(Mohammadi et al., 2018). RFID is
        considered as a prerequisite for this technology. From another
        perspective, the IoT is an environment where everything, whether
        human, animal or inanimate, possesses a unique Internet Protocol
        (IP) that has the ability to detect, control, send and transfer
        data to others and their respective databases. The data
        collected from objects will be visible through different tools
        such as mobile phones and a variety of computers and tablets.
        When IoT is implemented, data can be transferred across several
        objects. IoT is a function of the convergence and evolution of
        the three elements: Internet, wireless technology, and
        microelectromechanical systems. International Telecommunication
        Union defines IoT as follows: at any time and place, we will
        have something to which anyone can connect (Barcelo et al., 2016).

        4.1. Integration ERP and IoT

        Since the semantic web is considered to be an effective method
        for achieving the integration among systems, a model for
        integrating ERP and IoT is introduced here. Model of integration
        of cloud ERP APIs and things as a service (Darko Andročec et
        al., 2018). As shown in Figure 3, the IoT includes sensors,
        actuators, and applications (on mobile or Windows). Accordingly,
        the sensors collect data based on the actuator’s act. This
        information provides a common framework that allows data to be
        shared and connected to the cloud through the Semantic Web. The
        data is also linked to the IoT application via the cloud. ERP
        also manages and controls data through the cloud. The
        integration of IoT and ERP has many benefits, including the
        following:

        1. Events such as re-orders, replenishment, out of stock
        inventories and missed deliveries could be informed
        automatically through sensors and devices connected to the internet.

        2. IoT makes it possible to send notifications and warning to
        the manufacturers informing them that, for example, some of
        their products require their attention or some machines are
        down. Nevertheless, such a functionality is provided only when
        the business processes are adapted to this new model and be
        responsive to it.

        3. IoT provides a considerable amount of data that needs to be
        gathered, processed, and analyzed

        6

        appropriately to gain the maximum benefits from IoT ERP. The
        robustness of this software program, however, is a genuine
        concern. IoT ERP is expected to deal with the massive influx of
        data from different devices and products. Thus, a lot of
        pre-preparation is demanded of the manufacturing companies while
        they need to take into account the size of their current ERP
        program and whether it is capable of connecting to IoT.

        4. Real-time information is a prerequisite for an instant
        solution. The integration of ERP and IoT paves the way for
        real-time data and immediate solutions at the same time; this is
        possible through ERP, which provides a clear understanding of
        the situation while IoT offers the potential solutions. In fact,
        IoT will create junk information that can be extracted through
        ERP in an attempt to improve the business.

        5. Through the sensors, this integrated system is able to
        protect company products from theft. It does this through an
        alert message such that if the package is manipulated before it
        gets to the destination, an alert message or an email is sent to
        the registered number or email address of the customer.

        6. As for special or sensitive products whose maintenance
        demands special circumstances such as specific temperature or
        pressure, some IoT solutions safeguard these kinds of products
        against the environmental risks and keep the quality the same
        during the shipment.

        7. According to the traditional methods, the manufacturer could
        only check on the quality of a product that has been shipped to
        the destination only through some primitive techniques such as
        customer service calls or field visits. However, the advent of
        technologies such as IoT makes it possible for the customer to
        trace the product's status and find out about its use, behavior,
        wear, and tear. Even some powerful IoT devices demand to replace
        their parts after they detect wear and tear.

        8. There are two cases for selling the products: first, when the
        product is sold directly to the customer and second, when the
        product is sold through dealers. Of course, adopting the second
        approach poses a challenge to the ERP system in terms of keeping
        track of the end-users’ data. However, by enabling the products
        to communicate with their customer immediately after they are
        initiated, IoT resolves this problem.

        9. The automatic scan and entry of the barcode data are achieved
        through IoT in real-time. In other words, IoT reduces human
        intervention to a minimum through the sensors embedded inside
        the machines leading to improved production efficiency.

        7

        10. In a supply chain, IoT allows tracing the products or
        equipment as they are transferred from one stage to the next,
        and as a result, it provides real-time information.
        Subsequently, the real-time data is fed into the ERP system
        providing all those who are engaged with the supply chain with
        the feature which enables them to track the interdependencies
        between product life cycle and the material flow on the other
        hand. Insert Figure 3

        4.2. Analysis of published researches in IoT

        As we have seen, IoT is one of the key technologies working with
        ERP. In analysis review sections, according to our investigation
        on the IoT field, 140 articles were randomly selected from
        recent IEEE, ACM, and Elsevier journals from IEEE Explore, ACM
        Digital library, Arvix repository, and Elsevier. By reviewing
        these papers, the journals in this field in our database are
        shown in Figure 4. As shown in this figure, a majority of
        articles in our database are derived from the IEEE database,
        IEEE Access, ACM database, ACM Transactions on Internet journal,
        and Future Generation Computer System from Elsevier database.
        The IoT review articles are shown in Table 3. Insert Figure 4
        and Table 3 Here

        4.2.1. Taxonomy of IoT systems

        After analyzing the papers, the following categories were
        identified based on applications, architectures, technologies,
        challenges, and topics to be discussed in the future, which are
        shown in Figure 5 and will be discussed in more detail below.
        Insert Figure 5 Here

        4.2.1.1. IoT system architecture This section briefly describes
        the architecture of IoT systems. As can be seen in Figure 6, IoT
        networks include three layers, namely Application, Network, and
        Perception. Figure 6 shows the detailed architecture of IoT
        (Yang et al.,2011; Frustaci, 2017; Fang et al., 2014). The
        following example illustrates how IoT works. Smart parking,
        including sensors and microcontrollers, is located in each
        parking place. The user receives a live update about the
        availability of all parking places and chooses the best one. The
        ultrasonic sensors are used to relay information and display the
        available parking places in a web application. The IoT device
        consists of an ESP8266 microcontroller and an HC-SR04 distance
        measurement sensor. The sensor periodically measures the
        distance and transmits this data to the microcontroller, which
        is connected to AWS IoT service

        8

        via the MQTT protocol. Periodically, the device sends
        measurements to the cloud where they are stored in AWS IoT
        shadow as a sensor state. A sensor detects a parked car by
        measuring the distance to the nearest obstacle. We used this
        example in parts a,b and c. Insert Figure 6 Here

        a) Physical layer

        The physical object surface is involved with physical IoT
        sensors. The physical object is mainly involved with sensing,
        collecting, and sometimes processing information. At this level,
        diverse sensing functionalities are implemented through adapting
        sensors and actuators such as temperature, motion, or
        acceleration sensors. In the smart parking example, the
        ultrasonic sensors are in the physical layer.

        b) Connectivity

        One of the main goals of the IoT platform, communicate
        Heterogeneous sensors cooperatively, and subsequently provide
        smart services. Since the sensors deployed in IoT use battery
        for their power and their computation as well as storage
        capacity are limited, they are considered resource-limited.
        Therefore, IoT sensors should work with low-power sources under
        a lossy and noisy communication environment. Recent IoT
        communication technologies: 6LoWPAN, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4,
        WiFi, ultra-wide bandwidth, RFID, and near-field communication.
        In the smart parking example, the AWS IoT core is the service
        that manages the connection with the cloud.

        c) Middleware

        Middleware aims at demonstrating the complexity of a hardware
        system, and of course, this means more concentration on the
        problems by the developers without being disturbed at the
        hardware level. Several interfaces can be used to connect us to
        sensors and other objects, including Bluetooth, WI-Fi, RFID, and
        NFC. In a smart parking example, the AWS IoT Platform is middleware.

        d) Hardware-level

        Hardware complications are usually caused by related to
        communication and computation issues. A software level is
        provided across operating systems, applications as well as the
        network communication levels by the middleware, enabling
        cooperative processing. From a computational standpoint, a
        middleware provides a level that sits between application and
        system software and has the following main functions. First, it
        allows for collaboration between heterogeneous IoT objects so
        that diverse IoT classes communicate with each other without
        interruptions through the

        9

        middleware. Actually, the middleware plays a significant role in
        enabling the interoperability among IoT devices. The second
        major role played by the middleware concerns the devices, which
        are potential for interaction within the IoT domain. In fact, it
        provides these devices with scalability.

        The evolution of IoT devices is expected to be the outcome of
        middleware through critical reforms being made when scaling up
        the organization. The third role is the device discovery and
        environmental awareness, which has to be provided by middleware
        to support object knowledge of other surrounding IoT objects.
        Middleware is also in charge of providing the type of computing
        that is environmentally conscious so that the sensors' data
        become understandable, which can be employed to provide context
        and present intelligent services to users. Finally, in another
        role, the middleware addresses IoT security as well as its
        privacy, and that is because of human or industry involvement
        with the data presented by IoT. In other words, it is essential
        to take into account the sensitive issues of security and
        privacy; moreover, the firmware is expected to consider
        mechanisms to create a secure IoT system (Al-Garadi et al.,
        2018; Saheb and Izadi, 2019).

        e. Big data analytics

        The noticeable amount of data captured by IoT is highly
        valuable. Several physical objects existing in the different IoT
        applications are in charge of creating such big data. Thus, the
        large amount of data generated by the physical devices must be
        analyzed online to acquire useful knowledge. The timing of
        knowledge acquiring is useful. According to researchers, there
        are various ways to integrate big data analytics with IoT design
        so that this data becomes understandable. ML and DL go beyond
        the traditional analytic methods; in fact, they are capable of
        absorbing the invisible insight of big data and transforming it
        into useful data with a minimal human contribution (Al-Garadi et
        al., 2018).

        4.2.1.2. Applications of IoT in ERP systems

        IoT has several applications. The analysis of articles available
        in our database identified the applications of IoT shown in
        Figure7 and Table 4 along with the articles in our database
        (Smart grid, health care, monitoring, smart home, security,
        wearable devices, smart city, and energy). The most common
        applications of IoT were in Smart City (road management, smart
        agriculture, smart transportation, smart parking, and smart
        university), health care, and security. Insert Figure 7 and
        Table 4 Here

        a) Smart city

        10

        Cities inherently face complex, widespread, and interconnected
        challenges that can only be solved using a systematic approach.
        In other words, the massive crowding of residents leads to
        chaos, creating conditions that not only bring down the
        equilibrium of cities but prevent sustainability with current
        methods of urban management and development. Therefore, urban
        planners all over the world try to develop models of
        21st-century urban development, satisfying the new demands and
        expectations of today’s world with an integrated view for all
        aspects of urbanization. The development of a smart city is a
        new concept to address the current challenges of cities in the
        field of urban planning, which has attracted a lot of attention
        in recent years. A smart city has been the focus of the
        millennium transformation and development, which means opening
        new concepts in urban planning that combine the capabilities of
        real and virtual worlds to solve urban problems (Marjani et al.,
        2017).

        The ERP systems govern rules for purchasing, inventory usage,
        permitting, and billing. The city finance department tracks all
        public expenditures and incoming payments via the ERP system.
        Public works and city engineering utilize the work order system
        within the ERP system to respond to city building issues or
        infrastructure issues reported by citizens or identified by the
        real-time event management and analytics system.

        Planning, permitting, and inspections use geographical
        information systems (GIS) to manage the planning process for
        land usage throughout the city. The permitting process utilized
        with the ERP system allows permits to be requested online, and
        then the citizen or business can track the permit and inspection
        process as it is completed.Permits are issued online via the ERP
        permitting web portal. The permit process includes inspections
        of retention ponds throughout the city. The sensor network IoT
        will be utilized to provide water quality information and
        foliage growth data (Siegemund and Turau, 2018).

        b) Smart health care

        The IoT devices have become the heart of key health applications
        recently, having received a boost from the healthcare sector.
        Monitoring the health status of the patients, recording their
        information, notifying the related healthcare system of the
        critical circumstances, and subsequently facilitating the
        process of treatment for the patient in a timely manner is,
        among others, the significant roles of IoT devices in the
        healthcare systems. With almost 60% of the healthcare sector has
        implemented the Internet of medical things (IoMT) devices, the
        IoMT is believed to be leading to a revolution in the domain by
        turning disorganized healthcare into a synchronized one. IoT devices

        11

        made almost 30.3% of 4.5 billion IoT devices in 2015; however,
        the statistic had been predicted to rise to 20-30 billion by
        2020 (Afzal et al., 2017; Marjani et al., 2017; Baker et al., 2017).

        ERP, on the other hand, plays a major role in the healthcare
        sector by achieving an effective integration among the processes
        and the services.ERP would make a big difference in areas such
        as finance, human resources, and revenue and admission resources
        of the healthcare sector if it were implemented successfully.
        Services such as diagnosis, patient’s home care, and chronic
        care are provided by the healthcare system through the
        information they receive from various sources. Needless to say,
        these various sources and processes will be much more helpful
        for the healthcare system if they are integrated because
        integration allows for more information sharing while the
        traditional models are based on segregated processes and thus
        less information sharing. So by achieving integration across
        various systems in different locations and having access to
        them, ERP smoothes the healthcare processes, improve the quality
        of their services, and help the health fraternity to be more
        efficient in their jobs. Implementing ERP in a hospital is
        particularly beneficial for the front desk as well as the
        financial management sections.ERP provides the front-desk staff
        with the information they require, such as appointment, bed
        availability, specialized services, and the doctors’ schedules
        leading to the organized and effective performance of the front
        desk. The financial management also benefits from ERP because it
        offers solutions to cut costs, produce more comprehensive
        managerial reports, and reduce risks.

        c) Smart monitoring IoT monitoring has many advantages, some of
        which are listed below:  It helps in analyzing the dynamic
        systems and processing a large number of events and alerts.  It
        also gathers and analyzes IoT data from connected devices and
        applications and thus create integration between the devices and
        business.  It optimizes the performance across multiple
        applications, APIs, networks, and protocols and thus bridges the
        performance gaps  It provides you with feasible insights to
        create a better customer experience, mitigate the problems, and
        increase the IoT opportunities.

        d) Smart home

        Human presence detection, activity detection, self-organizing
        appliances, air conditioning control based on user desire and
        convenience, etc. are made possible by machine learning. In
        particular, the detection of activity due to its use in life
        support, home automation, etc., has received much

        12

        attention (Samie et al., 2019). For example, information
        regarding energy status, including its availability and price
        now or in the future, is provided by energy sources such as
        photovoltaic appliances and power suppliers. This information is
        used by devices which are considered the subscriber in an
        attempt to modify their patterns.

        e) Smart grid and smart meter Smart grid deals with effective
        ways to effectively manage and control energy production costs
        and save energy, which proves to be more reliable in achieving
        these goals than the conventional grid. Moreover, smart meters
        as modern energy meter makes power consumption measurable and
        help to monitor and control electrical devices.

        The smart grid, which is a flexible system connecting people
        with technology and natural systems, can be defined from
        functional or technological perspectives. It includes an
        electric grid, a communications network, and controlling and
        monitoring hardware and software and is capable of providing
        power, reducing costs, and presenting instant information. For
        example, the digital electricity grid which gathers and pass
        information, and creates electricity using the bilateral
        technical direction (Marjani et al., 2017).

        In relation to the smart grid and the onslaught of big data,
        financial transformation is achieved as a result of the demands
        of business transformation. Since utility companies are
        encouraging industry-changing advancements of this type, ERP
        systems strive to offer strategic insights for the better
        management and application of the gathered data.

        4.2.1.3. Relation with other technologies

        Another issue discussed in papers is the relationship of IoT
        with other technologies. As can be seen in Figure 8, machine
        learning and deep learning technologies make the most use of and
        have synergy with IoT technology in reviewed papers. To this
        end, we also examined a variety of methods used in this field
        among the articles, the results of which are shown in Figure 8.
        Insert Figure 8 Here

        a) Machine learning and deep learning methods in IoT

        Recently, a lot of IoT-based applications have emerged in
        various vertical fields, namely health, transportation, smart
        home, smart city, agriculture, education and so forth most of
        which are based on intelligent learning mechanism for prediction
        (i.e., regression, classification, and clustering), data mining,
        and pattern recognition of data analysis in general. Recently,
        deep learning (DP) has been employed in IoT applications more
        than other machine learning approaches. According to

        13

        an announcement made at the Gartner/ITxpo 2016 Symposium, DL and
        IoTwere among the top three strategic technology trends in 2017.
        This widespread advertising for DL points out the fact that the
        traditional machine learning approaches do not meet the newly
        identified analytical needs in the field of IoT. In other words,
        according to the hierarchy of IoT data generation and
        management, various modern analytical and artificial
        intelligence (AI) approaches are what IoT systems demand. The
        growing interest in IoT and the big data, which have a
        reciprocal relationship, demands shareholders who clearly
        understand its definition, components, potentials, and
        challenges. On the one hand, IoT is the major generator of big
        data, and on the other hand, IoT services are an essential
        target for analyzing big data to improve processes. In addition,
        big IoT data analysis has proven to be valuable to the
        community. For example, it was reported that identifying the
        damage to pipes and fixing them saved nearly one millionUS$ in
        the water bills of Miami Park Administration (Al-Garadi et al.,
        2018). DL models generally bring about two important advances
        relative to traditional machine learning approaches in training
        and prediction stages. Firstly, they reduce the need for manual,
        human-made, and engineered feature sets for use in education. As
        a result, some features that may not be apparent for men are
        easily extractable by DL models. Moreover, DL models improve
        accuracy. Neural networks and deep learning methods are
        generally used in ERP-based IoT systems for the following cases:

         Advanced analytics

        Machine learning and deep learning methods allow for handling a
        large amount of data paving the way for real-time and accurate
        data insights. As an example, we refer to AI for analyzing
        different types of customers’ buying behavior, providing one
        with the opportunity to adapt products or services to the needs
        of a specific audience.

         Warehouse management

        There are a large number of demand forecasting models which can
        be tested accurately using machine learning and deep learning
        methods to adapt various kinds of variables such as change in
        demand, supply chain disruptions as well as new product
        introduction.BMW, for example, traces an item from the time it
        is being manufactured until the moment it’s sold using learning
        algorithms while monitoring 31 assembly lines in different
        countries.

         Forecasting

        Machine learning and deep learning methods help find solutions
        that are capable of processing historical data and predicting
        the future. In the business world, these methods help identify

        14

        seasonal patterns and provide suggestions regarding the
        production volume.These forecasting methods provide the business
        world with more accurate predictions in a more cost-effective
        way and thus help avoid overproduction or underproduction by
        guiding through the decisions regarding the manufacturing volume.

         Financial management

        Machine learning and deep learning methods allow the automation
        of quarterly and monthly processes and the closure of operations
        after the accuracy reports are verified, and the account
        balances are compared. Invoice data can be categorized into
        different accounts using these methods, enabling us to
        differentiate between a phone purchase and a monthly phone bill.

         Interdepartmental processes

        It is complicated to integrate sales, inventory, and accounting.
        However, Artificial Intelligence is not afraid of massive
        amounts and various types of data, making it the perfect
        solution for creating a centralized platform.

         Customer service

        In the case of field services, these methods provide users with
        the information regarding performance evaluations and the
        qualification of the employees so that the planning is
        facilitated and the service calls are scheduled.

         Production processes

        In case of integration with ERP these methods, help to identify
        the inefficient processes and offer a solution to reduce costs.
        Moreover, these methods help to detect energy-consuming
        processes and facilitate predictive diagnoses and thus
        contribute to less waste of resources.

         Human resources

        ERP software enabled by AI can be proactive, and this is a big
        advantage because, for example, it can analyze the applicants'
        data based on their qualification parameters such as skills and
        experience, it can find out which employee needs to be promoted.

         Sales automation

        Chatbots powered by AI help not only customers but also conduct
        the whole sales triangle. Now, bots can cope with segmentation
        and provide responses in real-time. After reviewing our
        database, the methods used in these articles are as follows
        (shown in Figure 9). Accordingly, SVM, CNN, reinforcement
        learning, and autoencoder were the most commonly used tools in
        the articles. Some of these articles are discussed below;

        15

        Insert Figure 9 Here

        Another framework operating within the IoT ecosystem was
        presented by Khelifi et al. (2018) for a decision-support system
        (DSS). The proposed framework, which has been compared with
        three machine learning prediction model classifiers, i.e., Naïve
        Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree and empirically
        evaluated using data sets from a commercial network,
        demonstrated efficiency with a complete Bayesian network
        prediction model. Chen and Hao (2019) concentrated on feature
        dimension reduction of wireless communication signals and took
        the power amplifier radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting as an
        example of the output of their efforts. The researches conducted
        on the RF fingerprint feature dimension reduction method focus
        mainly on reducing the high dimensionality of RF fingerprint
        features and the uncorrelated or redundant features in the
        features space. In another paper, Tang et al. (2017)describe how
        CNN inference engines can enable deep-learning tasks on IoT
        devices. Ateeq et al. (2019) employed historical data from
        machine learning (ML) and proposed a proactive architecture for
        prediction. Their proposed model named adaptive moving window
        regression (AMWR) was derived from an adaptive prediction
        algorithm and was evaluated using a real-world use case (traffic
        data provided by the city of Madrid) with an accuracy of over
        96%. Adnan Akbar et al. (2017) presented a proactive
        architecture that exploits historical data using machine
        learning (ML) for prediction in conjunction with complex event
        processing. A semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning model
        was introduced by Mohammadi et al. (2018), which employs
        Variational Autoencoders (VAE) as the inference engine to
        generalize optimal policies. This model can be deployed in
        applications related to smart cities using labeled and unlabeled
        data to facilitate the performance as well as the accuracy of
        the learning agent.

        Tekeste et al. (2018) concentrated on developing technologies
        such as Machin Learning (ML), cloud Computing as well as IoT in
        an attempt to develop a more cost-effective system for water
        quality monitoring replacing the traditional way of quality
        monitoring. Xiao et al. (2018), on the other hand, concentrated
        on the IoT system from different perspectives such as the attack
        model, security solutions based on different techniques of
        machine learning such as supervised learning, unsupervised
        learning, and reinforcement learning. Samie et al. (2018),
        Mohammadi (2018), Khelifi (2018), and Al-Garadi et al. (2018)
        presented infrastructure toolsets that provide elastic
        provisioning of application components on resource-constrained
        and heterogeneous edge devices in large-scale IoT deployments.
        After reviewing the papers and results, we have discussed the
        machine learning and deep learning approaches in more detail.
        The advantages, disadvantages,

        16

        and applications and references to these methods are presented
        in Tables 5 and 6.

        Insert Tables 5 and 6 Here

        4.1.3. The challenge related to cloud ERR and IoT

        Several challenges have been discussed in the reviewed articles.
        As mentioned, because IoT systems are associated with cloud ERP,
        many challenges, open issues, and future directions are
        associated with cloud services (Brous et al., 2019; Karimanzira
        and Rauschenbach, 2019; Gubbi et al., 2013; Amendola et al.,
        2014; Kamilaris and Pitsillides, 2016; Cai et al., 2017; Samie
        et al., 2018; Cui et al., 2018).

        1.1.3.1.Heterogeneity

        A big problem with the cloud ERP-IoT paradigm lies in the
        extensive heterogeneity of available devices, operating systems,
        platforms and services, and possibly recently upgraded
        applications. cloud platform heterogeneity is not something to
        be overlooked. Typically, there is an overlap in ownership of
        objects for cloud services, allowing for proper merging and
        customization of resources according to each provider. This
        problem is exacerbated when users take advantage of multiple
        cloud platforms.

        Providers should consider target scenarios, analytic
        requirements, choice of hardware and software environments, a
        combination of heterogeneous subsystems, development, and
        delivery of computing infrastructure, and provision of
        maintenance services for each service or application. On the
        other hand, thanks to the presentation paradigms of cloud
        services, it is hoped that the IoT paradigm will easily end up
        in IoT service provision, although the implementation requires
        solving the big problem of heterogeneity. For example, it is
        necessary to appropriately combine (and manage) a large number
        of highly heterogeneous objects (and their correspondingly
        generated data) across different levels of the cloud platform.
        This problem encompasses a variety of dimensions, and its
        solutions are under consideration based on integrated platforms
        and middleware, interactive programming interfaces, duplication
        tools in the presence of data variety, and so forth (Alam et
        al., 2017).

        4.1.3.2. Functionality

        In this section, we focus on the challenges related to
        Functionality discussed in the reviewed articles:

        a) Performance

        Most cases of cloud ERP-IoT paradigm applications provide
        specific functionality and quality of

        17

        service (QoS) requirements (for example, communication and
        computing and storage aspects) and, in some scenarios, meet
        requirements that are not easily accessible. Specifically,
        achieving stable and acceptable network performance for the
        cloud paradigm is a major problem as the increasing bandwidth
        does not lead to an evolution in storage and computing since
        timeliness is greatly influenced by unpredictable problems,
        real-time applications are essentially vulnerable to performance
        bottlenecks.

        b) Latency (Delay)

        The term latency, also known as turnaround time, in the context
        of mobile cloud computing, means the time when the computation
        is offloaded, and the results are received from the nearby
        infrastructure or cloud.

        c) Energy efficiency

        Energy efficiency refers to a way through which the growth of
        energy consumption can be managed and prevented. By delivering
        more services for the same energy input or for the same services
        for less energy input, maybe something more energy efficient.

        d) Resource limitations

        Since the IoT architecture is resource-constrained, it has been
        difficult to define a robust security mechanism for it, and thus
        in order to work within such constraints, the algorithms have to
        be limited. For a successful implementation of IoT security and
        communication protocols, the storage and energy requirements
        need to be managed with each broadcast or multicast necessary
        for keys or certificates exchange. This means that these
        protocols should be lightweight and energy-efficient despite the
        complicated computations and improved energy harvesting techniques.

        e) Cost-effectiveness

        A major challenge for the SIoT application is to provide an
        efficient and profitable service development for energy and
        computing costs. A major challenge for the SIoT application is
        to provide an efficient and profitable service development for
        energy and computing costs. Multiple processes can run
        simultaneously, which may change as per variation in
        applications and user requirements.

        f) Reliability

        In the field of intelligent transportation, cars are usually on
        the move most of the time, and vehicle networking and
        communications are often disrupted or unreliable. When using
        applications in limited-resource environments, there are a few
        problems with a crash or lack of sustained

        18

        availability of the device. On the other hand, cloud
        capabilities help overcome some of these problems; for instance,
        cloud technology improves the reliability of devices by making
        it possible to reduce the burden of heavy tasks and thereby
        increase battery life or enable modular architecture;
        alternatively, the technology itself has uncertainties regarding
        data center virtualization or resource depletion.

        4.1.3.2. Large scale

        New applications can be designed using the cloud ERP-IoT
        paradigm to integrate and analyze the information received from
        (embedded) real-world tools. Some of the presented scenarios
        implicitly require interaction with a large number of these
        tools, which are usually scattered across large environments.
        The large scale of the mentioned systems makes it more difficult
        to solve common problems (for example, when dealing with
        long-life data that are collected at high speeds, the
        requirements of storage capacity and computing capability will
        be increasingly difficult to meet). In addition, the
        distribution of IoT tools complicates monitoring tasks due to
        dynamic time lag and connectivity issues.

        4.1.3.3. Big data

        Special attention must be paid to the transfer, storage, and
        access and processing of the enormous amount of data that will
        be generated given 50 billion devices estimated to be connected
        to the network by 2020. Thanks to recent advances in technology,
        IoT will be a major source of big data, and our cloud system
        enables us to store and analyze complex data for long periods
        and perform complex analytics on them. The ubiquity of mobile
        devices and sensors inevitably requires scalable computing
        platforms. Convenient handling of this volume of data is a
        sensitive issue since the overall performance of applications
        depends heavily on the features of data management services. For
        instance, cloud-based approaches to summarizing big data based
        on extracting semantic features are under investigation. Hence,
        following the NoSQL movement, both proprietary and open-source
        solutions use alternative database technologies for big data,
        which includes: time series, key-value, key-value repositories,
        large column repositories, and graph databases. Unfortunately,
        there is no excellent data management solution for the cloud
        system to handle big data. Moreover, data integrity is
        considered an important factor not only because of its impact on
        service quality but due to the security and privacy dimensions
        that are particularly relevant to outsourced data.

        4.1.3.4. Sensor network

        19

        Sensor networks have been defined as the major enablers of IoT
        and one of the five technologies that are shaping our world,
        giving us the ability to measure, understand and perceive
        environmental signals; recent advances in technology have
        allowed for efficient, inexpensive, and low-cost small tools to
        be used for remote sensing applications on a large scale.
        Furthermore, despite their limitations in battery consumption
        and reliability, smartphones have multiple sensors (GPS,
        accelerator, digital compass, microphone, and camera) that
        support a wide range of mobile applications in various areas of
        IoT. In this context, the timely processing of massively
        transmitted sensor data, which are vulnerable to power and
        network constraints, is a newly introduced problem. The cloud
        system offers new opportunities to collect sensor data and use
        them for widespread coverage and relevance, but at the same time
        overshadows the privacy and security aspects. In addition,
        although IoT devices are not mobile, which is considered a
        common dimension, the sensitivity of sensors in smartphones and
        wearable electronics devices is still a problem.

        4.1.3.5. Monitoring

        It has been widely documented in resources that surveillance is
        an essential activity in cloud environments for capacity
        planning, resource management, service level agreements,
        performance, and security as well as troubleshooting. As a
        result, the cloud ERP-IoT paradigm has the same regulatory
        requirements as the cloud system; however, the problems
        associated with this paradigm are also sensitive to the
        properties of the volume, variety, and speed of IoT.

        4.1.3.6. Fog computing

        Fog computing is part of the classic cloud computing operating
        on the periphery of the network. It is a system designed to
        support IoT applications with features such as time delay
        constraints and requirements concerning mobility and geographic
        distribution. Although computing, storage, and networking of
        resources are both cloud and fog systems, the latter has certain
        features as follows: being on the edge of the network and aware
        of the time-delayed geographic location; geographic distribution
        and a large number of nodes compared to concentrated cloud
        system; support for object mobility (via wireless communication)
        and real-time interaction (rather than batch processing);
        support for interaction. It is difficult to design cloud
        computing projects in multiple forms. Certainly, adopting
        cloud-based approaches requires a variety of specific algorithms
        and methodologies that examine the reliability of smart device
        networks and operate under specific conditions demanding
        error-resolving methods.

        4.1.3.7. Security

        20

        This section discusses the security challenges discussed in the
        articles (Restuccia et al., 2018).

         Security and trust management

        When it comes to the widespread adaptation of technology,
        security is always a critical issue. It is essential to
        establish a trust to strengthen communication among two or more
        IoT devices. Efficient authentication and trust management tasks
        in different SIoT application scenarios need to be ensured
        through flexible and strong security protocols within OS, each
        of which may require a specific kind of encryption algorithm.
        However, for implementing these algorithms, they need to be
        computationally less intensive; they need to operate in
        real-time to prevent performance degradation, and finally, they
        should take into account the memory and latency requirements.
        Correspondingly, the memory handling can also raise security
        concerns.

         Privacy

        Data privacy is of great significance since it poses a major
        challenge preventing consumers from adopting cloud computing.
        The consumers’ trust must be established to meet this challenge,
        and this can be achieved when the application models cover
        application development with privacy protection and implicit
        authentication mechanisms (Marjani et al., 2017).

        4.1.3.8. Complex environment

        A complicated IoT ecosystem is made of various elements such as
        software programs, hardware devices, different connected
        objects, and, most importantly, a large number of end-users.
        Some practical applications are built based on this ecosystem,
        demonstrating its influence. However, real-time IoT applications
        mostly demand a large amount of data, which requires storage and
        processing resources to extract intelligent information, and
        this is almost an uncharted territory in the existing IoT
        literature.

        4.1.3.9. Real-time processing

        Since a considerable number of requests from various types of
        smart applications along with fast responses are managed in the
        IoT ecosystem simultaneously, compared with the cloud-based
        applications, IoT applications

        From tracking cattle to bespoke weather forecasts, AI technology
        is helping smallholders across Asia and Africa. But it is by no
        means clear yet whether it will be a game changer in eliminating
        global poverty./*

        Anyone following tech news these days understands that the
        coexistence of artificial intelligence (AI) and mankind – and
        the ethical conflicts that may arise from it – is no longer
        science fiction. There is unease about AI influencing our online
        shopping and social media habits; about it replacing both menial
        and high-skilled jobs; enhancing surveillance and policing, and
        contributing to the development of more sophisticated weapons.

        The primary concern for businesses and governments today is how
        to better understand and harness big data, the internet of
        things
        <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/what-is-the-internet-of-things-google>,
        exponentially rising computing power and speed, memory capacity
        and intelligent algorithms. For those working in international
        development, the motivation is to apply the promise and
        potential of AI towards solving some of the world’s most
        challenging economic, social and environmental issues.

        Artificial intelligence is not one specific technology, but
        rather a broad spectrum of computer systems and applications
        that have the ability to perform tasks associated with human
        intelligence. With its unparalleled capacity to mine and parse
        vast amounts of data in record time; precision in identifying
        and collecting information even from locations and market
        segments where data is scarcely available; and its predictive
        and responsive power, AI technology stands to progress
        development and humanitarian efforts at a rate never witnessed
        before.

        US-based aWhere
        <https://www.businesscalltoaction.org/member/awhere> and
        Swedish Ignitia
        <https://www.businesscalltoaction.org/member/ignitia>, both
        members of the UN’s Business Call to Action (BCtA) platform, are
        already using predictive AI, proprietary algorithms and advanced
        analytics to deliver agricultural intelligence and
        ultra-accurate weather forecasts to smallholder farmers in
        Africa and Asia.

        Initially a research project to improve accuracy of weather
        predictions, Ignitia pioneered a tropical weather forecasting
        model, and the organization say that has proven to be 84 percent
        accurate, more than twice as accurate as global forecasts
        <http://www.ignitia.se/iska>. Today, 329,000 small-scale farmers
        in west Africa rely on it for GPS-specific weather forecasts to
        make better and quicker decisions regarding sowing and planting,
        application of fertilizers, and harvesting. All the farmers need
        is a standard phone – Ignitia takes satellite data, runs it
        through the AI model and sends out tailored text message forecasts.

        Will AI be a bane or boon for global development?

        According to Ignitia, an independent study carried out by
        University of California Berkeley in 2017 found that harvests
        increased by 65 percent on average after just one season with
        Iska (Ignitia’s flagship service), and resulted in farmers
        earning up to US$480 more from their crops. Considering it only
        comes to 2 percent of total input costs, farmers are already
        seeing the benefits.

        Global predictions for AI in agriculture suggest it will be
        worth more than $2.6 billion by 2025
        <https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/ai-in-agriculture.asp>.
        Increased investments are propelling the development and
        commercial deployment of technologies, from yield prediction
        algorithms to drone irrigation and discovery of next-generation
        proteins in biotechnology.

        Uruguayan agtech startup Chipsafer
        <https://www.chipsafer.com/> produces wearable technology that
        tracks livestock activity in near real-time, detects anomalies
        in cattle behaviour and helps isolate disease outbreaks.
        Individual animals are fitted with solar powered collars or tags
        that collect, process, and transmit data to Chipsafer’s
        analytical centres, allowing ranchers from Brazil to Australia
        to improve herd production, prevent cattle theft and contain the
        outbreak of diseases before they spread.

        The company is currently offering technological solutions around
        livestock insurance too. “Our technology provides accurate and
        timely data on livestock herds, soil conditions, pasture quality
        and water sources – the data that is currently missing for
        determining risk and insurance profiles for rural livestock,”
        says founder and chief executive Victoria Alonsoperez.
        “Chipsafer stands ready to develop new index based livestock
        insurance offerings, which will bring transformational benefits
        for the farmers.”

        These solutions are already available for many large-scale
        commercial farmers, and companies such as BCtA members in the
        agricultural sector are working to make them accessible for the
        world’s 2.5 billion smallholder growers and their families. It
        is the owners of the smallest plots who stand to benefit the
        most from the democratization and broad uptake of AI solutions
        as their first line of defence against challenges such as
        climate change, a growing population and food security.
        Ultimately, AI could be a game changer in eliminating hunger,
        reducing poverty and achieving responsible consumption and
        production.

        Some experts might say it could still be decades before machine
        intelligence becomes ubiquitous or is hailed as either boon or
        bane of human existence. It is up to the current generation to
        shape the commercial, ethical and regulatory context in which
        the technology develops, to serve rather than harm humankind.
        One thing is clear – the old systems are falling short in the
        face of the daunting challenges of today, and we only have the
        future to look to for solutions.
