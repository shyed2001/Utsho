d. What is the primary advantage and disadvantage of using the <main> element vs. <div id="main">? 


 

The main element's primary advantage is that it is a semantic element. It has meaning. The div element 
by itself does not describe the content. The primary advantage of using a div element is that it is 
common fully supported by older browsers.
