      <h3 class="question" data-answerId="answer41">Can I reserve a specific make or model of car?</h3>
      <div class="answer" id="answer41">
        <p>Due to the dynamic nature of our rental fleet, Avis is not able to guarantee a specific make or model of a vehicle. However we do guarantee the group you are booking and you will receive any type of vehicle within that car group. Car groups and models may vary by location and may not be available at all locations.</p>

      <h3 class="question" data-answerId="answer48">What refuelling options do I have?</h3>
      <div class="answer" id="answer48">
        <p>When you rent a car with Avis there are 3 options for refuelling:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At the end of your rental you can stop at a petrol station to refuel and return the vehicle with a full tank of fuel.</li>
          <li>To save time and money you can pre-pay your fuel at a competitive price. This can be organised at the rental counter when you collect.</li>
          <li>Running short on time? We'll fill the vehicle up for you, however please note this will be done at a premium price.</li>
